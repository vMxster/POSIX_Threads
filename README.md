## Introduction

POSIX threads, or Pthreads, provide a standard thread interface for POSIX-compliant operating systems such as Linux, Unix, and macOS. This repository is designed to guide beginners through the process of learning about multithreading concepts using POSIX threads in the C programming language.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning about POSIX threads, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vMxster/POSIX_Threads_UNI.git
```

Then, navigate to the cloned directory and explore the various examples, exercises, and projects provided.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains a collection of simple examples that demonstrate how to create, manage, and synchronize POSIX threads in C. These examples cover topics such as thread creation, mutual exclusion, condition variables, and thread cancellation.

## Exercises

The `exercises` directory contains a set of exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of POSIX threads concepts. These exercises range from basic to advanced and cover various aspects of multithreading, including synchronization, communication, and thread safety.

## Projects

In the `projects` directory, you'll find complete multithreading projects that apply the concepts learned from the examples and exercises. These projects provide practical experience in developing multithreaded applications using POSIX threads.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, additional examples, exercises, or projects related to POSIX threads, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
